# Parametric-Heart-Renderer
A Python-based visualization tool that utilizes the turtle graphics library to render a complex heart shape using parametric equations. The script calculates x and y coordinates based on the following mathematical functions: x=15⋅sin3(k) y=13⋅cos(k)−5⋅cos(2k)−2⋅cos(3k)−cos(4k)  By iterating through 6,000 data points.
